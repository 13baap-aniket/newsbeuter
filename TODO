TODO:
- check whether date parsing uses the correct timezone
- refactor XML pull parser (many redundancies)
	ignore comments
	join two subsequent text nodes separated by a comment
- implement podcast support
	- test more thoroughly
	- implement "start player" function in podbeuter.
- fill table with html entities
- do entitity decoding for titles (this may be controversial...)
- implement planet support
	- create examples
	- make title user-settable via first tag
	- write documentation

longteam goals to reach:
- add scripting support
- make script functions callable via key bindings

DONE:
- clean up items that have been added but whose URL has been removed from the config file.
- key for directly jumping to next unread article.
- OPML import/export
- open link in browser
- cache items in local database (sqlite?)
	used location:
		~/.newsbeuter/urls -- the list of feed URLs
		~/.newsbeuter/cache.db -- the feed and item cache
- optimize cache updates (every feed and every item needs something like a "dirty" flag)
- improve HTML rendering (write/use XML/HTML pull parser)
- configuration file
- fix the "foobar"/ issue in the XML pull parser
- fix display issues in test RSS file
- implement custom keybindings
- update status line to correct key mapping
- preliminary fix for the sort-by-date problem
- delete old entries _based_on_the_date_ (implement RFC 2822 parser!)
- add online help screen
- "next unread" error message must be shown differently
- save function
- use multithreading to download feeds so that simultaneous browsing/reading is possible.
	- only one "reload-all" operation may run at once
	- fix memleak (pthread_cleanup_push)
- set current path in filebrowser head
- set correct keymap hint in filebrowser
- reload feed from the itemlist
- "next unread" also for feedlist
- improve configuration parser (!!comments!!)
- implement "source view" in itemview.
- made feedlist head fancier
- added "toggle item read" function
- implemented an urlview-like interface
- add proxy configuration support
- add auto-reload feature
- add color configuration support
- support for atom (talk to mRss guy?) - implement by yourself?
- implement search
	- own dialog
	- result list on top
	- search input field on bottom
	- set correct title in search dialog
- add default save path configuration option
- improve configuration parser: support quoting
- i18n/l10n
- implemented podcast support:
	- when newsbeuter finds new entries with podcast enclosures in it, it puts it into a "queue" (text file in ~/.newsbeuter)
	- the actual downloading and saving is done by "podbeuter", which is a more a download manager that dequeues entries and downloads them.
	- write "advanced topics - podcasts" section in documentation
	- improved rendering of itunes:summary descriptions.
	- implement "resume download" function
	- write podbeuter.1 manpage
	- set configured colors
- implement planet support
	- implement this as an additional tool "nb-planet"
	- options:
		- planet-output ~/public_html/planet.html (that's also the default)
		- planet_title "My Planet"
		- planet-limit 50 (display the 50 latest articles)
	- implement template system
