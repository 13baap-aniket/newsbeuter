The Newsbeuter RSS Feedreader
=============================
Andreas Krennmair <ak@synflood.at>

Introduction
------------
Newsbeuter is an RSS feedreader. RSS is a number of widely-used XML formats to
transmit, publish and syndicate articles, for example news or blog articles.
Newsbeuter is designed to be used on text terminals on Unix or Unix-like
systems such as Linux, BSD or Mac OS X.

Why "Newsbeuter"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Newsbeuter" is a pun on the German word "Wildbeuter", which means
"hunter-gatherer". During the stone age, people hunted and gathered their food,
and these days, they hunt and gather news and information. Credits for this
idea goes to Clifford Wolf, who submitted it to a little competiton that was
started when I got aware that the original name would violate French and
European registered trademarks.

Installation
------------
This chapter describes how to compile and install newsbeuter from source.

Downloading Newsbeuter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Newsbeuter is available as source package. Simply go to
http://synflood.at/newsbeuter.html[] and download the latest source package,
which is usually in the .tar.gz file format. Alternatively, you can check out
the latest development source tree from the newsbeuter SVN repository by
running the following command on the commandline:

svn co http://bereshit.synflood.at/svn/noos/trunk

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Newsbeuter depends on a number of libraries to function correctly. This table
lists these dependencies. Please be aware that the list libraries may
themselves depend on other libraries. These dependencies are not listed here.
Please also be aware that you need a recent C++ compiler. Currently, newsbeuter
has only been tested with GCC.

- STFL: http://www.clifford.at/stfl/[]
- SQLite 3: http://www.sqlite.org/[]
- libmRss: http://www2.autistici.org/bakunin/libmrss/[]
- libnXml: http://www2.autistici.org/bakunin/libnxml/[]
- Coco/R for C++: http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/coco/

In the case of Coco/R, you need to install the resulting binary under the name
"coco-cpp" somewhere in your $PATH. If you use Debian and the corresponding
package of Coco/R, then this is already correct.

Compiling and Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you've downloaded and installed the dependencies mentioned above, you can
start compiling and installing newsbeuter. To compile newsbeuter, simply run
"make" in the source tree. After a short time, this should complete
successfully, and you can go on with installation by running "make install". By
default, this will install the "newsbeuter" binary to the /usr/local/bin
directory. You can provide an alternative installation path using the prefix
parameter, e.g. running "make install prefix=/opt/newsbeuter" will install the
binary to the directory /opt/newsbeuter/bin.


First Steps
-----------
After you've installed newsbeuter, you can run it for the first time by typing
"newsbeuter" on your command prompt. This will bring you the following message:

	Error: no URLs configured. Please fill the file /Users/ak/.newsbeuter/urls with RSS feed URLs or import an OPML file.

	newsbeuter 0.4
	usage: ./newsbeuter [-i <file>|-e] [-u <urlfile>] [-c <cachefile>] [-h]
		-r              refresh feeds on start
		-e              export OPML feed to stdout
		-i <file>       import OPML file
		-u <urlfile>    read RSS feed URLs from <urlfile>
		-c <cachefile>  use <cachefile> as cache file
		-C <configfile> read configuration from <configfile>
		-v              clean up cache thoroughly
		-h              this help


This means that newsbeuter can't start without any configured feeds. To add
feeds to newsbeuter, you can either add URLs to the configuration file
$HOME/.newsbeuter/urls or you can import an OPML file by running "newsbeuter -i
blogroll.opml". To manually add URLs, open the file with your favorite text
editor and add the URLs, one per line:

	http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
	http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml

If you need to add URLs that have restricted access via username/password, simply
provide the username/password in the following way:

	http://username:password@hostname.domain.tld/feed.rss

In order to protect username and password, make sure that
$HOME/.newsbeuter/urls has the appropriate permissions.

Now you can run newsbeuter again, and it will present you with a controllable
list of the URLs that you configured previously. You can now start downloading
the feeds, either by pressing "R" to download all feeds, or by pressing "r" to
download the currently selected feed. You can then select a feed you want to
read, and by pressing "Enter", you can go to the article list for this feed.
This works even while the downloading is still in progress.  You can now see
the list of available articles by their title. A "N" on the left indicates that
an article wasn't read yet. Pressing Enter brings you to the content of the
article. You can scroll through this text, and also run a browser (default:
lynx) to view the complete article if the content is empty or just an abstract
or a short description. Pressing "q" brings you back to the article list, and
pressing "q" again brings you back to the feed list. Pressing "q" a third time
then closes newsbeuter.

Newsbeuter caches the article that it downloads. This means that when you start
newsbeuter again and reload a feed, the old articles can still be read even if
they aren't in the current RSS feeds anymore. Optionally you can configure how
many articles shall be preserved by feed so that the article backlog doesn't
grow endlessly (see below).

Several aspects of newsbeuter's behaviour can be configured via a configuration
file, by default $HOME/.newsbeuter/config. This configuration files contains
lines in the form "<config-command> <arg1> ...".  The configuration file can
also contain comments, which start with the '#' character and go as far as the
end of line. If you need to enter a configuration argument that contains
spaces, use quotes (") around the whole argument.

Keys, as used in the bind-key configuration command, use a special syntax.
Lowercase keys, uppercase keys and special characters are written literally.
The Enter key is written as "enter", while the ESC key is written as "esc". The
function keys F1 to F12 are written as "F1" to "F12". The Space key is written
as "space". Key combinations with the Ctrl key, such as Ctrl-R, are written as
^r. Please be aware that all Ctrl-related key combinations need to be written
in lowercase ^R for Ctrl-Shift-R does not work.

Example Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# a comment
	max-items        100 # such comments are possible, too
	browser          links
	show-read-feeds  no

	unbind-key       R
	bind-key         ^r    reload-all

Configuring Colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to configure custom color settings in newsbeuter. The basic configuration 
syntax is:

	color <element> <foreground color> <background color> [<attribute> ...]

This means that if you configure colors for a certain element, you need to provide
a foreground color and a background color as a minimum. The following colors are
supported:

- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white
- default

The "default" color means that the terminal's default color will be used.

Optionally, you can also add one or more attributes. The following attributes are
supported:

- standout
- underline
- reverse
- blink
- dim
- bold
- protect
- invis

Currently, the following elements are supported:

- *listnormal*: a normal list item
- *listfocus*: the currently selected list item
- *info*: the info bars on top and bottom
- *background*: the application background
- *article*: the article text

The default color configuration of newsbeuter looks like this:

	background   white   black
	listnormal   white   black
	listfocus    yellow  blue   bold
	info         yellow  blue   bold
	article      white   black

Advanced Features
-----------------

Tagging
~~~~~~~

Newsbeuter comes with the possibility to categorize or "tag", as well call it,
RSS feeds. Every RSS feed can be assigned 0 or more tags. Within newsbeuter, you
can then select to only show RSS feeds that match a certain tag. That makes it
easy to categorize your feeds in a flexible and powerful way.

Usually, the ~/.newsbeuter/urls file contains one RSS feed URL per line. To
assign a tag to an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by
blanks such as space or tab. If the tag needs to contain spaces, you must use
quotes (") around the tag (see example below). An example ~/.newsbeuter/urls
file may look like this:

	http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
	http://rss.orf.at/news.xml news orf
	http://www.heise.de/newsticker/heise.rdf news interesting

When you now start newsbeuter with this configuration, you can press "t" to select
a tag. When you select the tag "news", you will see all three RSS feeds. Pressing
"t" again and e.g. selecting the "conspiracy" tag, you will only see the
http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html RSS feed. Pressing "^t" clears the current tag,
and again shows all RSS feeds, regardless of their assigned tags.

Scripts and Filters (Snownews Extensions)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From version 0.4 on, newsbeuter contains support for Snownews extensions. The
RSS feed readers Snownews and Liferea share a common way of extending the
readers with custom scripts. Two mechanisms, namely "execurl" and "filter" type
scripts, are available and supported by newsbeuter.

An "execurl" script can be any program that gets executed and whose output is
interpreted as RSS feed, while "filter" scripts are fed with the content of a
configured URL and whose output is interpreted as RSS feed.

The configuration is simple and straight-forward. Just add to your
~/.newsbeuter/urls file configuration lines like the following ones:

	exec:~/bin/execurl-script
	filter:~/bin/filter-script:http://some.test/url

The first line shows how to add an execurl script to your configuration: start
the line with "exec:" and then immediately append the path of the script that
shall be executed.  If this script requires additional parameters, simply use
quotes:

	"exec:~/bin/execurl-script param1 param2"

The second line shows how to add a filter script to your configuration: start
the line with "filter:", then immediately append the path of the script, then
append a colon (":"), and then append the URL of the file that shall be fed to
the script. Again, if the script requires any parameters, simply quote:

	"filter:~/bin/filter-script param1 param2:http://url/foobar"

In both cases, the tagging feature as described above is still available:

	exec:~/bin/execurl-script tag1 tag2 "quoted tag"
	filter:~/bin/filter-script:http://some.test/url tag3 tag4 tag5

A collection of such extension scripts can be found on this website:
http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/snowscripts/extensions[]

If you want to write your own extensions, refer to this website for further
instructions: http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/snowscripts/writing[]

Podcast Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A podcast is a media file distributed over the internet using syndication feeds
such as RSS, for later playback on portable players or computers.  Newsbeuter
contains support for downloading and saving podcasts. This support differs a bit
from other podcast aggregators or "podcatchers" in how it is done.

Podcast content is transported in RSS feeds via special tags called
"enclosures". Newsbeuter recognizes these enclosures and stores the relevant
information for every podcast item it finds in an RSS feed. What the user then
can do is to add the podcast download URL to a download queue. Alternatively,
newsbeuter can be configured to automatically do that. This queue is stored in
the file $HOME/.newsbeuter/queue.

The user can then use the download manager "podbeuter" to download these files
to a directory on the local filesystem. Podbeuter comes with the newsbeuter
package, and features a look and feel very close to the one of newsbeuter. It
also shares the same configuration file.

.Podbeuter Configuration Commands
[frame="all", grid="all",format="dsv",separator="|"]
`10`15`15`40`20~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration Command|Argument(s)|Default|Description|Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
download-path|<path>|~/|Specifies the directory where podbeuter shall download the files to.|download-path "~/Downloads"
max-downloads|<number>|1|Specifies the maximum number of parallel downloads when automatic download is enabled.|max-downloads 3
player|<player command>|""|Specifies the player that shall be used for playback of downloaded files.|player "mp3blaster"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Available Operations in Podbeuter
[frame="all", grid="all", format="dsv"]
`20`20`60~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operation:Default key:Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
quit:q:Quit the program.
pb-download:d:Download the currently selected URL.
pb-cancel:c:Cancel the currently selected download.
pb-delete:D:Delete the currently selected URL from the queue.
pb-purge:P:Remove all finished and deleted downloads from the queue and load URLs that were newly added to the queue.
pb-toggle-download-all:a:Toggle the "automatic download" feature where all queued URLs are downloaded one after the other. The "max-downloads" configuration option controls how many downloads are done in parallel.
pb-increase-max-dls:+:Increase the "max-downloads" option by 1.
pb-decrease-max-dls:-:Decrease the "max-downloads" option by 1. If the option is already 1, no further decrease is possible.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A usual "use case" is to configure newsbeuter to automatically enqueue newly
found podcast download URLs. Then, the user reloads the podcast RSS feeds in
newsbeuter, and after that, he/she uses podbeuter to view the current queue, and
either selectively download certain files or automatically download them all
together by pressing "a" within podbeuter.
