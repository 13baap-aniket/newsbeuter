The Newsbeuter RSS Feedreader
=============================
Andreas Krennmair <ak@synflood.at>

Introduction
------------
Newsbeuter is an RSS feedreader. RSS is a number of widely-used XML formats to
transmit, publish and syndicate articles, for example news or blog articles.
Newsbeuter is designed to be used on text terminals on Unix or Unix-like
systems such as Linux, BSD or Mac OS X.

Why "Newsbeuter"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Newsbeuter" is a pun on the German word "Wildbeuter", which means
"hunter-gatherer". During the stone age, people hunted and gathered their food,
and these days, they hunt and gather news and information. Credits for this
idea goes to Clifford Wolf, who submitted it to a little competiton that was
started when I got aware that the original name would violate French and
European registered trademarks.

Installation
------------
This chapter describes how to compile and install newsbeuter from source.

Downloading Newsbeuter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Newsbeuter is available as source package. Simply go to
http://synflood.at/newsbeuter.html[] and download the latest source package,
which is usually in the .tar.gz file format. Alternatively, you can check out
the latest development source tree from the newsbeuter SVN repository by
running the following command on the commandline:

svn co http://bereshit.synflood.at/svn/noos/trunk

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Newsbeuter depends on a number of libraries to function correctly. This table
lists these dependencies. Please be aware that the list libraries may
themselves depend on other libraries. These dependencies are not listed here.
Please also be aware that you need a recent C++ compiler. Currently, newsbeuter
has only been tested with GCC.

- STFL (version 0.14 or newer): http://www.clifford.at/stfl/[]
- SQLite 3: http://www.sqlite.org/[]
- libmRss (version 0.18.0 or newer): http://www2.autistici.org/bakunin/libmrss/[]
- libnXml (version 0.18.0 or newer): http://www2.autistici.org/bakunin/libnxml/[]

If you intend to modify the filter language parser, you will also need Coco/R for C++,
which you can download from http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/coco/[]. The Coco/R binary
must be installed as "coco-cpp" in your PATH. Debian users only need to install
the package "coco-cpp".


Compiling and Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you've downloaded and installed the dependencies mentioned above, you can
start compiling and installing newsbeuter. To compile newsbeuter, simply run
"make" in the source tree. After a short time, this should complete
successfully, and you can go on with installation by running "make install". By
default, this will install the "newsbeuter" binary to the /usr/local/bin
directory. You can provide an alternative installation path using the prefix
parameter, e.g. running "make install prefix=/opt/newsbeuter" will install the
binary to the directory /opt/newsbeuter/bin.

Example Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# a comment
	max-items        100 # such comments are possible, too
	browser          links
	show-read-feeds  no

	unbind-key       R
	bind-key         ^R    reload-all

Configuring Colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to configure custom color settings in newsbeuter. The basic configuration 
syntax is:

	color <element> <foreground color> <background color> [<attribute> ...]

This means that if you configure colors for a certain element, you need to provide
a foreground color and a background color as a minimum. The following colors are
supported:

- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white
- default

The "default" color means that the terminal's default color will be used.

Optionally, you can also add one or more attributes. The following attributes are
supported:

- standout
- underline
- reverse
- blink
- dim
- bold
- protect
- invis

Currently, the following elements are supported:

- *listnormal*: a normal list item
- *listfocus*: the currently selected list item
- *info*: the info bars on top and bottom
- *background*: the application background
- *article*: the article text

The default color configuration of newsbeuter looks like this:

	background   white   black
	listnormal   white   black
	listfocus    yellow  blue   bold
	info         yellow  blue   bold
	article      white   black

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Filter Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newsbeuter provides a powerful filter language that enables the user to
filter the content of many dialogs, such as the feed list or the article
list. The basic concept is that every feed and every article has a
number of attributes which can then be compared with user-supplied
values, and these comparisons and be logically AND'ed, OR'ed and
grouped.

Examples for simple filter expressions are:

	unread_count > 0
	rssurl =~ "^https:"

Logically connecting and grouping such expressions looks like in the
following examples:

	( unread_count > 0 and unread_count < 10 ) or total_count > 100
	( author =~ "Frank" or author =~ "John" ) and ( title =~ "Linux" or title =~ "FreeBSD" )

The possibilities for combining such queries is endless, sky (actually:
the available memory) is the limit.

To filter your feeds, press "F" in the feed list, enter your filter expression,
and press enter.  To clear the filter, press Ctrl-F. To filter the articles in the article list,
press "F", enter your expression, and press enter. Clearing the filter works the same as before.
Be aware that only certain attributes work in both dialogs. The table below lists all available
attributes and their context, i.e. an attribute that belongs to a feed can only be matched
in the feed list, while an attribute that belongs to an article can only be matched in the 
article list.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that it's also possible to filter for feed attributes when you query for
article attributes. This is because every article is internally linked to the
feed from which it was downloaded.


Killfiles
~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, a user is confronted with certain content he doesn't want to read,
e.g. on topics the user is not interested in or articles from certain people he
doesn't want to read. In Usenet, such functionality within software is
traditionally called a "killfile", i.e. based on the content of this "killfile", 
articles that match certain conditions do not get displayed and are not presented
to the user at all.

In newsbeuter, such a "killfile" can be implemented on a per-article basis via
the configuration file. The most important configuration command for this
is "ignore-article":

	ignore-article "*" "title =~ \"Gentoo\""
	ignore-article "http://synflood.at/blog/index.php?/feeds/index.rss2" "title =~ \"newsbeuter\""

The basic format is that the user specifies an RSS feed for which the ignore
shall be applied ("*" matches all RSS feeds), and then a filter expression (see
previous section). If newsbeuter hits an article in the specified RSS feed that
matches the specified filter expression, then this article is ignored and never
presented to the user. The configuration itself can contain as many
ignore-article commands as desired.


Query Feeds
~~~~~~~~~~~

Query feeds are a mechanism of newsbeuter to define custom "meta feeds" by using 
newsbeuter's built-in filter language. A query feed is a feed that is aggregated
from all currently downloaded articles of all feeds. To narrow down the set of
articles, the user has to specify a filter. Only articles that match this filter
are added to the query feed. A query feed is updated whenever it is entered in
the feed list. When you change the unread flag of an article, this is reflected
in the feed where the article was originally fetched.

To define a query feed, the user has to add a line to the file
~/.newsbeuter/urls in the following format:

	query:<name of feed>:<filter expression> [<tag> ...]

The "query:" in the beginning tells newsbeuter that it's a query feed, "<name of
feed>" specifies the name under which the query feed shall be displayed in the
feed list, and "<filter expression>" is the filter expression that shall be
used. Like every other feed, a query feed can be tagged to organize it like
a regular feed.

A good example for the user of this feature is a query feed that contains all
unread articles:

	"query:Unread Articles:unread = \"yes\""

Note the quotes that are necessary around the complete query "URL" and the
backslashes that are necessary the escape the quotes in the filter expression.

If you want to combine several feeds to one single feed, a good solution is to
tag the feeds that you want to combine with one certain tag, and then create a
query feed that only displays articles from feeds with that certain tag:

	http://domain1.tld/feed.xml fun news tag1
	http://domain2.tld/?feed.rss private jokes tag1
	http://domain3.tld/feeds.rss news
	"query:tag1 Articles:tags # \"tag1\""

In this example, the feeds http://domain1.tld/feed.xml and
http://domain2.tld/?feed.rss are aggregated into the query feed named "tag1
Articles", but the feed http://domain3.tld/feeds.rss is not.

Basically, the possibility of what can be realized with query feeds is only
limited by what can be queried from articles and feeds with the filter language
and by your creativity.


Bloglines Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://www.bloglines.com[Bloglines] is a web-based RSS feed reader. Newsbeuter
provides a synchronization feature that makes it possible to download unread
articles from Bloglines (which can then be optionally be marked as read). This
is useful in cases where you want to use the web frontend e.g. at work, and use
newsbeuter e.g. when you're at home. It is also possible to use newsbeuter as
an offline reader for Bloglines.

To enable Bloglines support, you first need to set the following configuration
variable:

	urls-source "bloglines"

By default, this is set to "local", which means that the list of configured
URLs is retrieved from ~/.newsbeuter/urls. By setting it to "bloglines",
newsbeuter will retrieve the list of retrieved URLs directly from Bloglines.
This means that you can only either use the locally configured URLs or the URLs
from Bloglines. Combination of both is not possible.

After setting the URLs source, you also need to set the Bloglines authentication configuration:

	bloglines-auth "username@emailaddress.com:yourpassword"

In the configuration variable "bloglines-auth", you provide your Bloglines
login (i.e. your email address) and your password, separated by a colon (":"). Optionally, you can configure that all messages that are downloaded are marked as read in the Bloglines web frontend:

	bloglines-mark-read "yes"

After you've configured newsbeuter for Bloglines, you can start it up. Newsbeuter
will then download the RSS feed URLs subscribed in Bloglines, which you can then
reload.

In this configuration, you need the possibility to connect to Bloglines. In
case you don't have access to Bloglines (e.g. a temporary network outage, or
you sit in a location without connectivity, e.g. a train), you can start
newsbeuter in offline mode:

	newsbeuter -o

With this commandline switch, you can read the articles that you have already
downloaded without any network connectivity. This functionality makes
newsbeuter a true offline client for Bloglines.


Podcast Support

`20`20`60~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operation:Default key:Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
quit:q:Quit the program.
pb-download:d:Download the currently selected URL.
pb-cancel:c:Cancel the currently selected download.
pb-delete:D:Delete the currently selected URL from the queue.
pb-purge:P:Remove all finished and deleted downloads from the queue and load URLs that were newly added to the queue.
pb-toggle-download-all:a:Toggle the "automatic download" feature where all queued URLs are downloaded one after the other. The "max-downloads" configuration option controls how many downloads are done in parallel.
pb-increase-max-dls:+:Increase the "max-downloads" option by 1.
pb-decrease-max-dls:-:Decrease the "max-downloads" option by 1. If the option is already 1, no further decrease is possible.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A usual "use case" is to configure newsbeuter to automatically enqueue newly
found podcast download URLs. Then, the user reloads the podcast RSS feeds in
newsbeuter, and after that, he/she uses podbeuter to view the current queue, and
either selectively download certain files or automatically download them all
together by pressing "a" within podbeuter.
