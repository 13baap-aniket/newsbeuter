Like other text-oriented software, newsbeuter contains an internal commandline to
modify configuration variables ad hoc and to run own commands. It provides a flexible
access to the functionality of newsbeuter which is especially useful for
advanced users.

To start the commandline, type ":". You will see a ":" prompt at the bottom of
the screen, similar to tools like vi(m) or mutt. You can now enter commands.
Pressing the return key executes the command (possibly giving feedback to the
user) and closes the commandline. You can cancel entering commands by pressing
the ESC key. The history of all the commands that you enter will be saved to
\~/.newsbeuter/history.cmdline. The backlog is limited to 100 entries by default,
but can be influenced by setting the "history-limit" configuration variable.
To disable history saving, set the history-limit to 0.

Currently, the following commands are available:
