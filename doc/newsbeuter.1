.RE
This means that newsbeuter can\'t start without any configured feeds\&. To add feeds to newsbeuter, you can either add URLs to the configuration file $HOME/\&.newsbeuter/urls or you can import an OPML file by running "newsbeuter \-i blogroll\&.opml"\&. To manually add URLs, open the file with your favorite text editor and add the URLs, one per line:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
http://rss\&.cnn\&.com/rss/cnn_topstories\&.rss
http://newsrss\&.bbc\&.co\&.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss\&.xml
.fi
.RE
If you need to add URLs that have restricted access via username/password, simply provide the username/password in the following way:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
http://username:password@hostname\&.domain\&.tld/feed\&.rss
.fi
.RE
In order to protect username and password, make sure that $HOME/\&.newsbeuter/urls has the appropriate permissions\&. Newsbeuter also makes sure that usernames and passwords within URLs aren\'t displayed in its user interface\&. In case there is a \fI@\fR in the username, you need to write it as \fI%40\fR instead so that it can be distinguished from the \fI@\fR that separates the username/password part from the hostname part\&.
.sp
You can also configure local files as feeds, by prefixing the local path with "file://" and adding it to the $HOME/\&.newsbeuter/urls file:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
file:///var/log/rss_eventlog\&.xml
.fi
.RE
Now you can run newsbeuter again, and it will present you with a controllable list of the URLs that you configured previously\&. You can now start downloading the feeds, either by pressing "R" to download all feeds, or by pressing "r" to download the currently selected feed\&. You can then select a feed you want to read, and by pressing "Enter", you can go to the article list for this feed\&. This works even while the downloading is still in progress\&. You can now see the list of available articles by their title\&. A "N" on the left indicates that an article wasn\'t read yet\&. Pressing Enter brings you to the content of the article\&. You can scroll through this text, and also run a browser (default: lynx) to view the complete article if the content is empty or just an abstract or a short description\&. Pressing "q" brings you back to the article list, and pressing "q" again brings you back to the feed list\&. Pressing "q" a third time then closes newsbeuter\&.
.sp
Newsbeuter caches the article that it downloads\&. This means that when you start newsbeuter again and reload a feed, the old articles can still be read even if they aren\'t in the current RSS feeds anymore\&. Optionally you can configure how many articles shall be preserved by feed so that the article backlog doesn\'t grow endlessly (see "max\-items" below)\&.
.sp
Newsbeuter also uses a number of measures to preserve the users\' and feed providers\' bandwidth, by trying to avoid unnecessary feed downloads through the use of conditional HTTP downloading\&. It saves every feed\'s "Last\-Modified" and "ETag" response header values (if present) and advises the feed\'s HTTP server to only send data if the feed has been updated by modification date/time or "ETag" header\&. This doesn\'t only make feed downloads for RSS feeds with no new updates faster, it also reduces the amount of transferred data per request\&. Conditional HTTP downloading can be optionally disabled per feed by using the "always\-download" configuration command\&.
.sp
Several aspects of newsbeuter\'s behaviour can be configured via a configuration file, by default $HOME/\&.newsbeuter/config\&. This configuration file contains lines in the form "<config\-command> <arg1> \&..."\&. The configuration file can also contain comments, which start with the \fI#\fR character and go as far as the end of line\&. If you need to enter a configuration argument that contains spaces, use quotes (") around the whole argument\&. It\'s even possible to integrate the output of external commands into the configuration\&. The text between two backticks ("`") is evaluated as shell command, and its output is put on its place instead\&. This works like backtick evaluation in Bourne\-compatible shells and allows users to use external information from the system within the configuration\&.
.sp
Searching for articles is possible in newsbeuter, too\&. Just press the "/" key, enter your search phrase, and the title and content of all articles are searched for it\&. When you do a search from the list of feeds, all articles of all feeds will be searched\&. When you do a search from the article list of a feed, only the articles of the currently viewed feed are searched\&. When opening an article from a search result dialog, the search phrase is highlighted\&.
.sp
The history of all your searches is saved to the filesystem, to ~/\&.newsbeuter/history\&.search\&. By default, the last 100 search phrases are stored, but this limited can be influenced through the "history\-limit" configuration variable\&. To disable search history saving, simply set the history\-limit to 0\&.

.SH "TAGGING"
Newsbeuter comes with the possibility to categorize or "tag", as we call it, RSS feeds\&. Every RSS feed can be assigned 0 or more tags\&. Within newsbeuter, you can then select to only show RSS feeds that match a certain tag\&. That makes it easy to categorize your feeds in a flexible and powerful way\&.
.sp
Usually, the ~/\&.newsbeuter/urls file contains one RSS feed URL per line\&. To assign a tag to an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by blanks such as space or tab\&. If the tag needs to contain spaces, you must use quotes (") around the tag (see example below)\&. An example ~/\&.newsbeuter/urls file may look like this:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
http://blog\&.fefe\&.de/rss\&.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
http://rss\&.orf\&.at/news\&.xml news orf
http://www\&.heise\&.de/newsticker/heise\&.rdf news interesting
.fi
.RE
When you now start newsbeuter with this configuration, you can press "t" to select a tag\&. When you select the tag "news", you will see all three RSS feeds\&. Pressing "t" again and e\&.g\&. selecting the "conspiracy" tag, you will only see the http://blog\&.fefe\&.de/rss\&.xml?html RSS feed\&. Pressing "^T" clears the current tag, and again shows all RSS feeds, regardless of their assigned tags\&.
.sp
A special type of tag are tags that start with the tilde character ("~")\&. When such a tag is found, the feed title is set to the tag name (excluding the ~ character)\&. With this feature, you can give feeds any title you want in your feed list:

.SH "SCRIPTS AND FILTERS"
From version 0\&.4 on, newsbeuter contains support for Snownews extensions\&. The RSS feed readers Snownews and Liferea share a common way of extending the readers with custom scripts\&. Two mechanisms, namely "execurl" and "filter" type scripts, are available and supported by newsbeuter\&.
.sp
An "execurl" script can be any program that gets executed and whose output is interpreted as RSS feed, while "filter" scripts are fed with the content of a configured URL and whose output is interpreted as RSS feed\&.
.sp
The configuration is simple and straight\-forward\&. Just add to your ~/\&.newsbeuter/urls file configuration lines like the following ones:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
exec:~/bin/execurl\-script
filter:~/bin/filter\-script:http://some\&.test/url
.fi
.RE
The first line shows how to add an execurl script to your configuration: start the line with "exec:" and then immediately append the path of the script that shall be executed\&. If this script requires additional parameters, simply use quotes:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"exec:~/bin/execurl\-script param1 param2"
.fi
.RE
The second line shows how to add a filter script to your configuration: start the line with "filter:", then immediately append the path of the script, then append a colon (":"), and then append the URL of the file that shall be fed to the script\&. Again, if the script requires any parameters, simply quote:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"filter:~/bin/filter\-script param1 param2:http://url/foobar"
.fi
.RE
In both cases, the tagging feature as described above is still available:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
exec:~/bin/execurl\-script tag1 tag2 "quoted tag"
filter:~/bin/filter\-script:http://some\&.test/url tag3 tag4 tag5
.fi
.RE
A collection of such extension scripts can be found on this website: http://kiza\&.kcore\&.de/software/snownews/snowscripts/extensions

.SH "COMMAND LINE"
Like other text\-oriented software, newsbeuter contains an internal commandline to modify configuration variables ad hoc and to run own commands\&. It provides a flexible access to the functionality of newsbeuter which is especially useful for advanced users\&.
.sp
To start the commandline, type ":"\&. You will see a ":" prompt at the bottom of the screen, similar to tools like vi(m) or mutt\&. You can now enter commands\&. Pressing the return key executes the command (possibly giving feedback to the user) and closes the commandline\&. You can cancel entering commands by pressing the ESC key\&. The history of all the commands that you enter will be saved to ~/\&.newsbeuter/history\&.cmdline\&. The backlog is limited to 100 entries by default, but can be influenced by setting the "history\-limit" configuration variable\&. To disable history saving, set the history\-limit to 0\&.
.sp
Starting with newsbeuter 2\&.0, the commandline provides you with some help if you can\'t remember the full names of commandline commands\&. By pressing the TAB key, newsbeuter will try to automatically complete your command\&. If there is more than one possible completion, you can subsequently press the TAB key to cycle through all results\&. If no match is found, no suggestion will be inserted into the commandline\&. For the "set" command, the completion also works for configuration variable names\&.
.sp
In additon, some common key combination such as Ctrl\-G (to cancel input), Ctrl\-K (to delete text from the cursor position to the end of line), Ctrl\-U (to clear the whole line) and Ctrl\-W (to delete the word before the current cursor position) were added\&.
.sp
Please be aware that the input history of both the command line and the search functions are saved to the filesystems, to the files ~/\&.newsbeuter/history\&.cmdline resp\&. ~/\&.newsbeuter/history\&.search\&. By default, the last 100 entries are saved, but this can be configured (configuratin variable history\-limit) and also totally disabled (by setting said variable to 0)\&.
