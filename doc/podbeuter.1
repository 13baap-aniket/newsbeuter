.SH "PODCAST SUPPORT"
.sp
A podcast is a media file distributed over the internet using syndication feeds such as RSS, for later playback on portable players or computers\&. Newsbeuter contains support for downloading and saving podcasts\&. This support differs a bit from other podcast aggregators or "podcatchers" in how it is done\&.
.sp
Podcast content is transported in RSS feeds via special tags called "enclosures"\&. Newsbeuter recognizes these enclosures and stores the relevant information for every podcast item it finds in an RSS feed\&. Since version 2\&.0, it also recognizes and handles the Yahoo Media RSS extensions\&. What the user then can do is to add the podcast download URL to a download queue\&. Alternatively, newsbeuter can be configured to automatically do that\&. This queue is stored in the file $HOME/\&.newsbeuter/queue\&.
.sp
The user can then use the download manager "podbeuter" to download these files to a directory on the local filesystem\&. Podbeuter comes with the newsbeuter package, and features a look and feel very close to the one of newsbeuter\&. It also shares the same configuration file\&.
.sp
Podcasts that have been downloaded but haven\(cqt been played yet remain in the queue but are marked as downloaded\&. You can remove them by purging them from the queue with the \fIP\fR key\&. After you\(cqve played a file and close podbeuter, it will be removed from the queue\&. The downloaded file remains on the filesystem\&.
