# If set to "internal", then the internal HTML renderer will be used.
# Otherwise, the specified command will be executed, the HTML to be rendered
# will be written to the command's stdin, and the program's output will be
# displayed. This makes it possible to use other, external programs, such as
# w3m, links or lynx, to render HTML.
# ex. html-renderer "w3m -dump -T text/html"
