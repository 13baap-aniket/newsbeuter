newsbeuter - an RSS feed reader for text terminals


SYNOPSIS
--------
'newsbeuter' [-r] [-e] [-i opmlfile] [-u urlfile] [-c cachefile] [-C configfile] [-v] [-o] [-h]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'newsbeuter' is an RSS feed reader for text terminals. RSS is a number of
widely-used XML formats to transmit, publish and syndicate articles, for
example news or blog articles.  Newsbeuter is designed to be used on text
terminals on Unix or Unix-like systems such as Linux, BSD or Mac OS X.

-r::
        Refresh feeds on start

-e::
        Export feeds as OPML to stdout

-v::
        Clean up cache thoroughly (i.e. reduce it in size if possible)

-V::
        Get version information about newsbeuter and the libraries it uses

-i opmlfile::
       Import an OPML file

-c cachefile::
       Use an alternative cache file

-C configfile::

-o::
       Active offline reading mode. When bloglines synchronization mode is configured,
       then the list of feeds will not be loaded from bloglines.com, but instead from
       the local cache. This makes it possible to read locally cached articles even
       without internet connection to connect to the bloglines server.
