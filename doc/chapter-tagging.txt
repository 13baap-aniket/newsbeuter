Newsbeuter comes with the possibility to categorize or "tag", as well call it,
RSS feeds. Every RSS feed can be assigned 0 or more tags. Within newsbeuter, you
can then select to only show RSS feeds that match a certain tag. That makes it
easy to categorize your feeds in a flexible and powerful way.

Usually, the ~/.newsbeuter/urls file contains one RSS feed URL per line. To
assign a tag to an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by
blanks such as space or tab. If the tag needs to contain spaces, you must use
quotes (") around the tag (see example below). An example ~/.newsbeuter/urls
file may look like this:

	http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
	http://rss.orf.at/news.xml news orf
	http://www.heise.de/newsticker/heise.rdf news interesting

When you now start newsbeuter with this configuration, you can press "t" to select
a tag. When you select the tag "news", you will see all three RSS feeds. Pressing
"t" again and e.g. selecting the "conspiracy" tag, you will only see the
http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html RSS feed. Pressing "^T" clears the current tag,
and again shows all RSS feeds, regardless of their assigned tags.
