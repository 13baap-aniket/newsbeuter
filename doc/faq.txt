Newsbeuter FAQ
==============

I get errors like "`color01' is not a valid color"
--------------------------------------------------
Numbers that start with zero are treated as octal; starting with newsbeuter
2.10, these are not allowed since
https://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter/issues/186[they only add confusion].
Use decimal numbers instead.
